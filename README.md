Predicting mental health outcomes in the United States (2020) using CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).
BRFSS is a survey data collected by U.S. and established in 1984. It is the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world
with more than 400,000 adult interviewed each year on health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.

# Overview of an industry, business or problem:
Mental health is very important in a person's everyday life and is essential for having a happy life, it includes a person's emotional, psychological, and social well-being. Having any type of mental illness can start affecting how a person deals with work, stress, relationships and decision making. Therefore, mental health is heavily connected to financial stability and quality of life. Understanding the links between mental illness and certain lifestyle habits can help work towards finding solutions and educating people on what habits to avoid or continue. 


To better understand mental health, we explored possible mental health impact factors such as Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), physical health (any chronic disease or disability), physical activity (exercise time), behavior (sleep time) and/or social life(smoking, drinking), etc.

We utilized CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset to answer:
What’s the impact of ACEs to mental health?
Is physical health correlated to mental health?
How important is sleep time to mental health? 
Is drinking/smoking related to mental health?
Does accessibility to healthcare affect mental health?
Is there a trend between income, employment, and mental health status?

# Why does this problem matter? 
Lack of proper mental health not only reduces productivity and performance at the workplace, but also increases unemployment rate, absenteeism, healthcare costs and consequently costs for the business.
Understanding the relationship between a person’s mental wellbeing and their performance will also transform the perception of people with mental illness.
